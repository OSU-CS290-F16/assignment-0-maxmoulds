<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<h2>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
<p>There is no replacement for forced experience. I have used soo many guides and soo many people I cannot give credit to just one.
